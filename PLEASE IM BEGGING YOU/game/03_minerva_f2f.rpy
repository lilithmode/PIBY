    t "but you’re practically praying... what gave you that idea minerva?"

    pm "Well you’ve done so much for us."

    b "Ugh. This isn’t helping. Should I reboot it? Might actually have a chance next time. Could purge these guys and try to get a, uh, better emulation…"

    b "Wait, that may be too harsh-sounding."

    t "i don’t mean to put pressure"
    t "you shouldn’t feel this pressured, minerva, it’s fine"

    pm "I feel something in me, in my programmi--..."
